# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

1. HTML and CSS and Js code for landing page
2. I've used JS DOM structure to optain the required task to make the page interactive and dynamic
3. make the section in the viewport to stand out alongside its link in the nav bar
4. added button at the bottom right to be appeared when the used scrolls further down and wishes to   get back up with one click
5. made the scrolling exprience within the page very smooth by the help of js funtionality

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## the files listed as required
1. index.html
2. css/styles.css
3. js/app.js
